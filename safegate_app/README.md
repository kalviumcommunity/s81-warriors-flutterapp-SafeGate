## Reflection

During the setup, I faced challenges such as downloading Android system images and configuring the Android SDK path. After resolving these issues, Flutter Doctor showed a healthy environment. This setup prepares me to build, test, and debug real mobile applications efficiently using an emulator or physical device.
